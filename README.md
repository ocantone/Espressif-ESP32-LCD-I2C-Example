# Espressif-ESP32-LCD-I2C-Example-
This repo contains an example of H44780 LCD display driving using a platform ESP32. 
The code editor used was Visual Studio Code with the PlatformIO Ide plugin installed.
The source code has the .cpp extension instead of the .ino,but it can operate similarly in the Arduino IDE.
